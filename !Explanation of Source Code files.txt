In this directory, I included a ZIP file for each chapter which introduced code changes to the sample blog application built in the book.

For example, the "beginning-rails-6-blog-chapter-03.zip" file contains source code which reflects the state of the blog application at the end of Chapter 3. 

The final chapter's ZIP file reflects the completed sample application.
